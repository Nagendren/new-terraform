In this demo, we can see how to create Application load Balancer(ALB) using terraform.

Key points:

1) ALB is Route/Path based load balancer

2) We need to create Target Group (TG) and attach instance to TG.

3) Then we need to create listner and attach the TG

4) In listner, we can add rules and conditions for incoming traffic.
