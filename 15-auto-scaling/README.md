# Auto Scaling

In this demo, we can see how to create autoscaling in aws using terraform

> To setup autoscaling we need,
- AWS launch configuration
    > _specifies the properties of the instance to be launched like AMI id, security grp, etc_
-  Autoscaling group
     _This has scaling properties like minimum instance, max instance, health checks_
     _after autoscaling group setup, we can create autoscaling policies_
